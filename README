Part A
We worked on this project with Ubuntu 12.04 and using the gcc version 4.8.1. Under this environment, 
we managed to pass all of the given tests. However, after seeing the piazza post about the gcc version,
we tried running our code on various versions of gcc. Under v4.6, our code passed 10 tests, and under 
v4.8.2 (with Ubuntu 14.04), our code passed 11 tests. This shows that c code is very sensitive to the
envionment in which it is compiled/run. However, we did not have the time to account for the different
versions of gcc (also, it should be beyond the scope of the course). We have attached the output of
compiling and running the tests under our environment below.
